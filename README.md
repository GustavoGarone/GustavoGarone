## Hello ! 🍃

👋 My name's Gustavo, but you can call me Garone, Guga or Minze! I'm a Junior at the University of São Paulo studying statistics, although my background in computing has never left my heart.

🔠 I speak Portuguese and English fluently, and I can understand Spanish.

📨 You can mail me at gustavo.garone@usp.br for academic inquiries, or at gustavogarone@protonmail.com for business or anything else you'd like to talk about.

- 🔴🟢🟣 I’m currently learning [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), a great scientific programming language that is, dare I say, some good competition to R and Python! 🐍
- ❄🐧❄ I'm into FLOSS and I'm part of the GNU+Linux community. I use [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS), by the way ([checkout my system](https://github.com/GustavoGarone/minix))!
- 🎉 I really like engaging in small, silly projects to improve my learning in a fun, hands-on way. You can find some of them in my repos.
- 🧾 I have an unhealthy obsession with notes and LaTeX. Markdown is your friend, and so is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
- 🤝 I Like working in groups! Have a cool idea that you'd like to work on with me? HMU!

- 🪩 I like art and gaming and I am currently obsessed with [Car Seat Headrest](https://carseatheadrest.com/).
