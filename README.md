## Hello ! 🍃
- - -

My name's Gustavo, but you can call me Garone, Guga or Minze! I'm a freshman at University of São Paulo studying Statistics, although my background in computing has never left my heart.

- 🔵🔴🟢🟣 I’m currently learning Julia, a great statistical and scientific programming language and, dare I say, some good competition to R and Python! 🐍
- ❄🐧❄ I'm into FLOSS and the GNU+Linux community. I use NixOS, by the way!
- 🎉 I really like engaging into silly little projects to improve my learning in a fun way.
- 👊 Teamwork is #1.
- 📨 You can mail me @ gustavo.garone@usp.br for Academic inquiries, or @ gustavogarone@protonmail.com for Business or anything else you'd like to talk about.

- 🪩 I like art, gaming and am currently obsessed with Glass Beach and always with Yonkagor.
