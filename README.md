## Hello ! 🍃

👋 My name's Gustavo, but you can call me Garone, Guga or Minze! I'm a freshman at the University of São Paulo studying statistics, although my background in computing has never left my heart.

🔠 I speak Portuguese and English fluently, and I can understand Spanish.

📨 You can mail me at gustavo.garone@usp.br for academic inquiries, or at gustavogarone@protonmail.com for business or anything else you'd like to talk about.

- 🔴🟢🟣 I’m currently learning [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), a great statistical and scientific programming language and, dare I say, some good competition to R and Python! 🐍
- ❄🐧❄ I'm into FLOSS and the GNU+Linux community. I use [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS), by the way!
- 🎉 I really like engaging in small, silly projects to improve my learning in a fun way.
- 🧾 I have an unhealthy obsession with notes and LaTeX. Markdown is your friend, and so it [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax)!
  - 🔮 (Yes, that translates to "I'm an [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) User")
- 🤝 I Like working in groups!

- 🪩 I like art and gaming and I am currently obsessed with [Car Seat Headrest](https://carseatheadrest.com/) and always with [YonKaGor](https://www.youtube.com/c/yonkagor).
